            **Exploring, assessing, and leveraging trends of funding of start-ups within the Indian Ecosystem **

 

                                           **Introduction** 

India, one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, has witnessed an extraordinary surge in its start-up ecosystem over the past decade. This growth has been propelled by various factors, including increased funding availability, supportive government policies, and a pool of skilled talent. As a result, start-ups have emerged as crucial drivers of innovation and employment generation, contributing substantially to the country’s economic progress. In 2022, approximately 26,000 tech start-ups were operational in the country, and the total unicorn count reached an impressive 89, with 175 potential unicorns on the horizon. 

The aim of this data analytics is to provide comprehensive understanding how the startup ecosystem has developed over the years in India, understand the growth drivers as well as challenges.
